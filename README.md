## 🚀 About Me

I’m **Raghavendra Devale**, currently working as an **SDE Trainee**.

I’m interested in understanding how software systems work end-to-end — from data and APIs to user-facing features and overall system behavior.

I enjoy learning by doing: building features, breaking things, debugging issues, and refining solutions until they make sense.  
Rather than tying myself to a single role or technology, I focus on fundamentals that apply across systems.

🛠️ I like turning ideas into working software — and learning what *doesn’t* work along the way.

## 🧭 How I Learn

I learn best by building things and iterating on them.  
Most repositories here reflect that process — including mistakes, improvements, and evolving understanding.

Not everything here is polished.  
Everything here is intentional.
